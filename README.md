# Lua dotfiles

Nvim lua dots. Requires :
-   nvim 0.10
-   ripgrep
-   fzf
-   python3
-   lua

+ likely some other stuff that I don't remember. You'll get error messages, you fix em.

Based on Chris's [nvim dots](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) Which I took as my own and customized it to my linking

He also made a great youtube playlist explaining how luas dotfiles work which is really good:
